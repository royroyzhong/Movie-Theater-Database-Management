## Simple PHP Web Application for Movie Theater Database Management

Project Description:

Our website allows staff to add a new movie to our current movie list, so people can see what do we have in the movie list. Also, staff can remove the movie from the list. Once Users change their information, they can also update it. Users can search movies in our list by type and language, or they can use the checkbox we provided on the website. Users can input the year to find the corresponding movie name, product information, price, and theatre location. There is a button on our website to see the name of the movie that played at all theatres. We provide the different functions to let the user choose, once they select the function, it will show the corresponding info about the director and box office.
Users can also input the box office to find the director that has at least that much the box office. There is other option for the users to choose to see the rating for the directors.
